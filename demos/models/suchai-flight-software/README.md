SUCHAI Flight software was originally developed to be used in the 
[SUCHAI](http://spel.ing.uchile.cl/suchai.html) nanosatellite (1U 
[CubeSat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CubeSat)). SUCHAI was launch into orbit 
in June 2017 and has been working properly.

The main idea was to design a highly modular and extensible flight software architecture to help the
development of CubeSats projects that are composed by large and heterogeneous 
teams. Provides a ready-to-use nanosatellite flight software, a flexible way to add/remove functionalities or paylodads, and supports an incremental development.

The software architecture is based on the command processor design pattern. Developers
can extend the functionalities by adding new commands to the system (with low 
impact in the whole software) or adding new clients that can request any of the available
commands depending on their custom control strategy. Commands and control modules 
can be added or removed with zero impact in the software main functionalities.
Once a command is implemented, it can be used in the software itself and also
as a telecommand.

Current implementation uses the [LibCSP](https://github.com/libcsp/libcsp) to communicate subsytems and the ground station. Linux port can use the LibCSP with [ZMQ](http://zeromq.org/) interface.

## Build notes

SUCHAI flight software was designed to run in multiple embedded architectures 
using FreeRTOS. It was also ported to Linux to facilitate the development and debugging. 
Currently, it has been tested in the following OS/Architectures:

* Ubuntu 18.04 x86_64
* Manjaro x86_64
* ArchLinux x86_64
* Debian Stretch RPi 3 (armv7l)
* FreeRTOS ESP32
* FreeRTOS AVR32 UC3 (avr32uc3)
* FreeRTOS Nanomind A3200 (avr32uc3)

### Linux build

#### Requirements
Linux installation requires the following libraries:
* build-essential
* cmake
* pkg-config
* pthread (libpthread-stubs0-dev)
* cunit (libcunit1-dev)
* sqlite3 (libsqlite3-dev)
* zmq (libzmq3-dev)
* unzip
* postgresql
* libpq-dev
* python (python 2)
* python3

#### Clone
Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spel-uchile/SUCHAI-Flight-Software
cd SUCHAI-Flight-Software
```
Go to the folder, locate ```config.h``` file to customize parameters and 
functionalities.

#### Build
Use the ```compile.py``` python script to easily install drivers, create the
settings header ```configure.h``` and build:

```bash
python3 compile.py LINUX X86 --drivers
```

This will download and build the libcsp too. Subsequents builds do not require
the ```--drivers``` params. Use ```--help``` to learn how to customize the
build:

```bash
python3 compile.py --help
```

### Run
Go to the build folder ex: ```cd build_x86``` and execute

```bash
./SUCHAI_Flight_Software
```

#### Using ZMQ interface
In Linux, LibCSP uses the ZMQ interface to communicate different nodes. To pass
messages between zmq_hub interfaces, we required a ZMQ Forwarder Device (Proxy)
running in background. To start the ZMQ Forwarder server:

```bash
cd sandbox/csp_zmq
python3 zmqhub.py
```

It is possible to change the default ports (8001, 8002) and activate a monitor 
socket (8003) that will print all messages to ```stout``` using:

```bash
cd sandbox/csp_zmq
python3 zmqhub.py [-h] [-i IN_PORT] [-o OUT_PORT] [-m MON_PORT] [--mon] [--con]
```

A test ZMQ CSP Node is also available as an example, so it is possible to test
the communication between the node and the SUCHAI Flight Software. Run the
example node ```zmqnode.py``` using:

```bash
cd sandbox/csp_zmq
python3 zmqnode.py
```

Default parameters should work directly, but it is possible to set the ports and
```zmqhub.py``` ip address to connect to remote nodes through TCP/IP.

```bash
cd sandbox/csp_zmq
python3 zmqnode.py [-n NODE] [-d IP] [-i IN_PORT] [-o OUT_PORT] [--nmon] [--ncon]
```

Now you can try to send a command to the Flight Software from the example ZMQ
CSP Node, for example the `com_ping` to the node `1` (Flight Software node) on port `10` (csp ping).

```bash
cd sandbox/csp_zmq
python3 zmqnode.py 
Namespace(in_port='8001', ip='localhost', ncon=True, nmon=True, node=9, out_port='8002')

```

### Build for other architectures
Currently the flight software supports the following architectures (some platforms
may have limited or under development support):

First install the drivers for the desired architecture
```python3 compile.py <OS> <ARCH> --drivers```

- Nanomind A3200: ```python3 compile.py FREERTOS NANOMIND```
- Atmel AV32UC3 Xplained board: ```python3 compile.py FREERTOS AVR32 --comm 0```
- Raspberry Pi: ```python3 compile.py LINUX RPI```
- Esspressif ESP32: ```python3 compile.py FREERTOS ESP32 --comm 0 --fp 0 --hk 0 --st_mode 0```
