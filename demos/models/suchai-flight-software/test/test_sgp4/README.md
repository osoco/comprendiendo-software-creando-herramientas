# SGP4 Test

This test compares the SUCHAI SGP4 propagator results with Python 
Skyfield SGP4 propagator (https://pypi.org/project/sgp4).

The program reads a reference data file (data.csv) and calculates R and V for each
timestamp in this file. The compare the the results.

If necessary, the reference data file is generated by running `python3 generate_data.py`
Please not that the TLE used in `generate_data.py` and in `src/system/taskTest.c` test 
must be the same.

## About the results

The main sources of errors is the TLE epoch calculated in the Python and C code. The
C code uses an integer (long) with milliseconds precision, while Python uses a floating 
point value (double). Therefore there is a difference in the argument passed to the
propagator: `tsince` in minutes (floating point) since epoch.
